# East Coast Gyms

## Description

This is a front end design for a fictional gym based in East Lothian. The purpose of the website was to bring customers attention to the great facilities on offer here in east lothain.
- The Index pages gives an overview of what we offer as a gym and community. Opening hours to pictures of the gym itself.
- Our Facilities page gives visitors a more extensive breakdown of the gym and what facilities we have. 
- A contact page for potential clients to sign up and pass on some information so we can best advise on either prgram, memberships or trainer! This also gives a fully functioning GoogleMap.
- Our trainers page gives visual images of our trainers, a breif history of them and a breakdown of all of the skills and competencies.
- In our Members section you get a full breakdown of prices and offers set out by the gym.

## Deployment and Live page

The site has been deployed to github and is accessible on [Github Pages](https://github.com/alc232/MS1..2)

## Wireframe

I have drafted up a wireframe using Balsamiq. There were a few tweaks in design however the fundamentals are the same!
This can be found [here]('..Wireframe/New-Project-1.pdf')

## Breakdown

For the purpose of this project, I created a Gym Facility (like one I wish was local to myself) that I believe would capture the interest of the locals and of anyone new to the village. This could and would be a great local hotspot and focal point in the community.

As a gym we would welcome all people and bring togehter a very divided community.

## User Story

I identified that the  page would be useful to Members and guests alike. With the constant idea of expanding clientel and becoming a powerhouse in the fitness world:

### Members

- Need to know opening times.
- Members must have access to the class sign up list.
- Be able to see what prices we offere for different memberships.
- Be able to visually see who the trainers are in the gym.

These are accomplished by: 

- The opening hours are on the home page, easily readable and accessible.
- The contact page gives the address and a GoogleMap. They can also sign up here.
- The large Header images on each pages give the viewer clear insight on what information should be on the page.
- 

### Non-Members

- Need to know where to find the gym.
- Need to have access to a price list before arrival.
- I want to know what facilities are on offer.
- I want to guage what type of environment I could potentially be visiting.
- I would like to see who works there and what skills they have. 
- I would like to know what type of atmosphere there is.
